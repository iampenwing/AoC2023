# AoC2023

## My Stats

I'm doing this from the UK and so usually getting up several hours after the puzzle goes live so, yeah, I aint scoring points on the global leaderboard.

For up to about Day 10 I am not working so I can get started whenever. Days 11-15 I am in work so might have to prioritise that...

| Day | Part 1 Time | Part 1 Rank | Part 2 Time | Part 2 Rank |

## Day 1 Notes
Part 1 is simple enough - find the digits and make number from the first and last digits

Part 2 adds the idea that digits can be spelt out. 
<details>
  <summary>What is not made clear - and is necessary for the right result - </summary>
  
  is that spelt out "digits" can overlap - so `eightwo` is actually `82`, not `8wo` (or `eigh2` if your matching in reverse)

  I added the `AoCLib.getDigits` function to do this including the overlapping (which I hate). Basically rather than skipping to the character after the end of the spelled out digit, it skips to the last character when continuing the search for digits. 

  I could also look at `getFirstDigit` and `getLastDigit` (based on a reversed list and backwards spelt digits) functions rather than finding all the digits then getting first and last...
</details>


I also think I got composing functions right so I can map with `calibrate . AoC.getDigits` rather than  mapping with each separately.

## Day 2 Notes
Well, this is definitely a puzzle where parsing the input into usable data structures was the biggest part of the challenge. I use a lot of shortcuts because of the simplicity of the data and there is no error checking. 

## Day 3 Notes
Eugh - I hate these grid ones...The parsing I did for Part 1 was insufficient for Part 2, but at least it was enough scaffolding to add some additional data to what I was pulling out and then refactor into a different format to use in Part 2. 

Why do I keep doing this to myself?!?

## Day 4 Notes
I finally got round to adding an `ints` style function to AoCLib (`getInts :: String -> [Int]`) - this is a function which extracts all Integers from a string. At the moment, it doesn't handle negative numbers - minus signs are just discarded as "rubbish"

## Day 5 Notes
Yeah, I knew simply making a list of all the seeds and running through for Part 2 was not going to work, but eugh the debugging on this one once I settled on the splitting ranges solution...

## Day 6 Notes
Recognised early onthat it was probably better to use the quadratic equation stuff to calculate this rather than testing each possible game.

Part 2 required escalating up the data types for the necessary precision (I was off by 1 because of precision issues first time I ran with `ÃŒnt`s and `Float`s rather than `Integer`s and `Double`s. 

## Day 7 Notes
Urghh... This would not have taken two and a half hours if I hadn't had a complete brainfart on Insertion Sorting - that took most of my debugging... **hint** you need the helper function to insert into the accumulator.

## Day 8 Notes
Oh noooooo, it's Chinese Remainder Theory

<details>
  <summary>Part 2...</summary> 
  
It helps to just "randomly" know that each cycle starts at ``..A`` and ends at ``..Z`` and be confident enough of that that then you can just use ``lcm`` (Lowest Common Multiplier) without having to worry about offsets. You just need to know that information. Or be told it explicitly.
</details>

## Day 9 Notes
Simple, very simple. Except that I had not got negative number reading in ``AoCLib.getInts`` - well, I do now...

## Day 10 Notes
Part 1 felt relatively straightforward. I collected more infor than I needed, technically, in case I was futureproofing for finding the manhatten distance in some way in Part 2...

I wasn't.

The basic solution to Part 2 came just after I left the house to do something, but refinement took sooooo long. I ended up slicing the loop up into column-slices to make it quicker to search as I was having to search it **a lot**. I was originally going to be counting and checking oddness in each direction but some frustrated searching convinced me, rightly, I only needed to search in one direction - apparently, this method is used in graphics a lot. 

Other people used wierd mathematical processes (shoelace theory) which I looked at and went "err... maybe not"

Part 2 has some fixes to bugs which are, techically, also in Part 1 (when S is on an edge, but not a corner) which only cropped up in one exaple for Part 2. 

## Day 11 Notes
Actually fairly simple - part 1 I wrote and had executing correctly almost immediately (I forgot a ``::`` in a function definition.

Part 2 required some refactoring to track expanded columns rather than just doubling them in the grid, and a bit more debugging, but again fairly simple...
